# Templates.AzureFunctions.ServicebusQueue

This repository contains an FSharp (F#) project template that can be used to create an Azure Function triggered by a Service Bus Queue. 
It is basically a translation of the C# project template generated by the Azure Functions Core Tools as of version 3.0.2534 and fixing a
number of small issues preventing it from working in F# initially.

Also, the project has been converted to use Paket package manager.
